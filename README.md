## Project Overview 

**Context and Value Proposition**

Many members of the public in Singapore approach pharmacists to purchase Prescription-Only Medications (POM) without a local doctor's prescription. It would be a wasted trip and they would leave the pharmacy disappointed. This confusion arises mainly because certain medications that were asked, eg. oral contraceptives/steroid creams/antibiotics, can be bought over-the-counter without consulting a doctor in other countries.

Medimap is a mobile-responsive web application with an interactive map that allows users to search for whether a medication is available in Singapore, whether it can be bought off-the-counter, and where the medications can be bought. 

*Caution: This web application is for demo purposes and is **NOT** intended to serve as health-related advices. Users are advised to visit Health Science Authority (HSA) website for the most updated drug regulations whenever in doubt.*   

**Target Audience**

Mainly targetting young to middle age (20-59 years old) adult foreingers and/or locals unaware of Singapore drug regulations and this is most common age group faced at the pharmacy for such enquiries.  

**Organisation Goals** 

1. Provides users quick information about the classification of a medication at their convenience, saving them time to travel to a nearby pharmacy for enquiry. 
2. Reduce waiting time at the pharmacy by directing related enquiries to appropriate platforms.   

**User Goals**

To know whether a medication is available in Singapore, whether it can be bought off-the-counter, and where the medications can be bought. 

## UI/UX 

**1. Strategy**

**User** 

- Demographic: Users may fall into either of the following - forgetting to bring their long term medications when travelling overseas, falling short of current supplies before travelling back (foreigner) or next appointment (locals/foreingers)

- Needs: To know whether a medication is available in Singapore, whether it can be bought off-the-counter, and where the medications can be bought.

- Pain points: Information about classification of medications on Health Science Authority's website is difficult to find.
